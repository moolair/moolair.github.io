Check Out My Updated Resume!

Come take a look at [my awesome resume](https://moolair.github.io/)!

If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me at youngjinjo@outlook.com 😊

I built this using Ruby and Jekyll with a static template, inspired by [sproogen](https://github.com/sproogen)'s [modern-resume-theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme) project.

If you have any questions about the modifications I made to the template, feel free to open an issue.
